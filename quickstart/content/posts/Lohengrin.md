Went to the Lohengrin premiere today in Bolshoi. Everything else in the world notwithstanding it was great. 

The Covid security continues to be formally tight.

Here's the choir:

And a more atmospheric shot:

The best desision was made with the Lohengrin character himself. He is, by definition, _alien_. Being a mythical character and interacting with historacal people he is usually portrayed as an otherwordly figure. In this performance it was backwards - Lohengrin (on the right) looks like an office worker:

who stumbled upon a faerie court. 

The voices were great, and I especially enjoyed Sergey Skorokhodov's titular performance.

Wagner remains my favorite German composer.
