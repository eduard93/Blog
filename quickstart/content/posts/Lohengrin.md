> Lohengrin is a Romantic opera in three acts composed and written by Richard Wagner, first performed in 1850. The story of the eponymous character is taken from medieval German romance, notably the Parzival of Wolfram von Eschenbach, and its sequel Lohengrin, itself inspired by the epic of Garin le Loherain. It is part of the Knight of the Swan legend.
>
> The opera has inspired other works of art. King Ludwig II of Bavaria named his castle Neuschwanstein Castle after the Swan Knight. It was King Ludwig's patronage that later gave Wagner the means and opportunity to complete, build a theatre for, and stage his epic cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen. He had discontinued composing it at the end of Act II of Siegfried, the third of the Ring tetralogy, to create his radical chromatic masterpiece of the late 1850s, Tristan und Isolde, and his lyrical comic opera of the mid-1860s, Die Meistersinger von NÃ¼rnberg.
>
> The most popular and recognizable part of the opera is the Bridal Chorus, colloquially known as "Here Comes the Bride," usually played as a processional at weddings. The orchestral preludes to Acts I and III are also frequently performed separately as concert pieces. 

Went to the Lohengrin premiere today in Bolshoi. Everything else in the world notwithstanding it was great. 

The Covid security continues to be formally tight.

Here's the choir:

The best desision was made with the Lohengrin character himself. He is, by definition, _alien_. Being a mythical character and interacting with historacal people he is usually portrayed as an otherwordly figure. In this performance it was backwards - Lohengrin (on the right) looks like an office worker:

who stumbled upon a faerie court. 

The voices were great, and I especially enjoyed Sergey Skorokhodov's titular performance.

Wagner remains my favorite German composer.
