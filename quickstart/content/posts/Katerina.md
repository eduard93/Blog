> Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk is an opera in four acts and nine scenes by Dmitri Shostakovich, his Opus 29. The libretto, jointly written by Alexander Preys and the composer, is based on the novella Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District by Nikolai Leskov. 

Randomly went to Katerina Izmailova. Was not disappointed. Dmitri Shostakovich is not my favorite composer - he sometimes adds too much extravaganza, but in here the music added great nuances to lyrics.

I don't know if the choir was particularly on point or everything is in the libretto, but it was basically a spoken/sang Russian and not the opera Russian. I'll certainly recommend it as a starter opera - it's easy to understand and has a compelling story, spawning romance, drama, comedy, and inevitable tragedy.

Best part was the Police Officer song. Truly, a masterpiece for the ages. Alexander Krasnov managed to make it hilarious and likable, despite the suject matter. If you know Russian - give it a listen.
